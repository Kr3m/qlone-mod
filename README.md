# Qlone mod
The (rebooted) Qlone mod for Quake III: Arena

This is a reboot of the Qlone project, a small mod bringing some nice stuff to Q3A and allowing me to spare some time playing with the Q3 code =)

This project is now based on [baseq3a](https://github.com/ec-/baseq3a) by Eugene C. which bring a nice codebase with enhancements to the bare Q3A SDK. Among others, some of the cool features is the Unlagged code, originally written by Neil "Haste" Toronto and the PM skins coming from [CPMA](https://playmorepromode.com/).

Qlone adds some nifty stuff like the FreezeTag gameplay, based on the Quake 3 [FreezeTag](https://github.com/dbircsak/freeze-tag) code by Darrell "Doolittle" Bircsak.
